The application process for univeristies and scholarships often feels like a black box, where your application goes in and either a "yes" or a "no" comes out. The exact reason for getting accepted or rejected are often not elaborated upon by institutions/committees. I have made my application materials for ETHZ available so hopefully prospective applicants can gain some insight into what might work when applying and hopefully make the process a bit more transparent.
