# [ESOP Motivation Letter and Research Proposal](/my-website/static/files/eth_esop_material.pdf)
The application process for univeristies and scholarships often feels like a black box, where your application goes in and either a "yes" or a "no" comes out. The exact reason for getting accepted or rejected are often not elaborated upon by institutions/committees. I have made my [application materials](/my-website/static/files/eth_esop_material.pdf) for ETHZ available so prospective applicants can gain some insight into what might work when applying. Hopefully this makes the process a bit more transparent.
