# Motivation Letter and ESOP Research Proposal
The application process for universities and scholarships often feels like a black box, where your application goes in and either a "yes" or a "no" comes out. The exact reasons for getting accepted or rejected are often not elaborated upon by institutions/committees. I have made my [application materials](/files/eth_esop_material.pdf) for ETHZ available so prospective applicants can gain some insight into what might work when applying. Hopefully this makes the process a bit more transparent.
