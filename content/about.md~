# Hello!

I'm currently a Master's student in [Molecular and Structural Biology](https://biol.ethz.ch/en/studies/master/master-degree-majors/structural-biology-and-biophysics.html) at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I have been fortunate to receive the [ESOP Scholarship](https://ethz-foundation.ch/en/projects/topics/talents/esop/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwusunBhCYARIsAFBsUP8q6UQowaPqw-7tM-FUJn_Ox5jk2iavhWtHubO_WKrXyYrOjJcwV8saAm9EEALw_wcB). As part of my thesis in the [Riniker Lab](https://riniker.ethz.ch/), I'm working with cyclic peptides, specifically exploring their potential as therapeutics and antibiotics using molecular dynamics simulations.

Before transitioning to computational research, my scientific background was primarily rooted in wet-lab work. I worked in the [Ban Lab](https://bangroup.ethz.ch/) as a semester project student, investigating non-canonical pathways of translation initiation. I also worked in the [Jonas Lab](https://jonaslab.ethz.ch/) as a semester project student, focusing on the early stages of ribosome biogenesis.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in [Pharmaceutical Sciences](https://www.acphs.edu/bachelors-pharmaceutical-sciences-major) with a minor in Mathematics from [Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences](https://www.acphs.edu/). Before moving to Zürich to pursue my Master's degree, I worked as a Research Assistant in the [Agrawal Lab](https://www.wadsworth.org/senior-staff/rajendra-agrawal) at [SUNY Albany](https://www.albany.edu/) in Albany, New York. There, I employed structural biology techniques (specifically cryo-EM) to understand the effects of antibiotics on the cellular translation machinery in context of the [mitochondria](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23726-4) and [mycobacteria](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.31.535098v1.abstract).

Outside the lab, I recently took part in the [Ideathon](https://www.studentbiolab.ch/ideathon), hosted and organized by the [Student Bio Lab](https://www.studentbiolab.ch/) in Zürich, where our team came in 1st place for proposing innovative strategies for better design of biodegradable plastics. I also participated in the iGEM competition during my sophomore year of university as part of the [Genspace team](https://2016.igem.org/Team:Genspace), a community biology lab based in Brooklyn, New York. The team won the [Best Measurement Award](https://2016.igem.org/Team:Genspace/Measurement). 

Music is another primary interest in my life. I've been playing the guitar for over 15 years, starting with classical/fingerstyle guitar and then progressing to different genres of electric guitar (metal, rock, funk). I have recently started playing the bass as well, and I serve as a bassist for two bands, [Visual Snow](https://www.instagram.com/visualsnow___/) (rock) and [PPTA](https://www.instagram.com/ppta_band/) (funk), and help organize [Resonance Jams](https://www.resonancejams.ch/en/), a weekly jamming session for musicians in Zürich. I also have experience giving guitar lessons. 

Other than science or music, my interests also extend to cooking, where I try as many recipes as possible from [J. Kenji López-Alt](https://www.youtube.com/@JKenjiLopezAlt), my newfound hobby of photography (usually while traveling), writing poetry and campaigns for D&D, reading on a wide range of topics from philosophy to fantasy, and more recently, playing Baldurs Gate 3.

Prior to my past two years in Zürich, I lived in the US for about ten years, in Indonesia for about two years, and in India for the first ten years of my life.
