The application process for universities and scholarships often feels like a black box, where your application goes in and either a "yes" or a "no" comes out. The exact reasons for getting accepted or rejected are often not elaborated upon by institutions/committees.

Below you can find my application materials for the MSc Molecular and Structural Biology program:

Hopefully this makes the process a bit more transparent and helps you craft a compelling application!
