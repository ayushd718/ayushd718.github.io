I&rsquo;m currently a Master&rsquo;s student in Molecular and Structural Biology at ETH Zürich, where I have been fortunate to receive the ESOP Scholarship. As part of my thesis in the Riniker Lab, I&rsquo;m working with cyclic peptides, specifically exploring their potential as therapeutics and antibiotics using molecular dynamics simulations.
Before transitioning to computational research, my scientific background was primarily rooted in wet-lab work. I worked in the Ban Lab as a semester project student, investigating non-canonical pathways of translation initiation."/>

    <div class="post-content">
        <h1 id="hello">Hello!</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently a Master&rsquo;s student in <a href="https://biol.ethz.ch/en/studies/master/master-degree-majors/structural-biology-and-biophysics.html">Molecular and Structural Biology</a> at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zürich</a>, where I have been fortunate to receive the <a href="https://ethz-foundation.ch/en/projects/topics/talents/esop/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwusunBhCYARIsAFBsUP8q6UQowaPqw-7tM-FUJn_Ox5jk2iavhWtHubO_WKrXyYrOjJcwV8saAm9EEALw_wcB">ESOP Scholarship</a>. As part of my thesis in the <a href="https://riniker.ethz.ch/">Riniker Lab</a>, I&rsquo;m working with cyclic peptides, specifically exploring their potential as therapeutics and antibiotics using molecular dynamics simulations.</p>
<p>Before transitioning to computational research, my scientific background was primarily rooted in wet-lab work. I worked in the <a href="https://bangroup.ethz.ch/">Ban Lab</a> as a semester project student, investigating non-canonical pathways of translation initiation. I also worked in the <a href="https://jonaslab.ethz.ch/">Jonas Lab</a> as a semester project student, focusing on the early stages of ribosome biogenesis.</p>
<p>I hold a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in <a href="https://www.acphs.edu/bachelors-pharmaceutical-sciences-major">Pharmaceutical Sciences</a> with a minor in Mathematics from <a href="https://www.acphs.edu/">Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences</a>. Before moving to Zürich to pursue my Master&rsquo;s degree, I worked as a Research Assistant in the <a href="https://www.wadsworth.org/senior-staff/rajendra-agrawal">Agrawal Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.albany.edu/">SUNY Albany</a> in Albany, New York. There, I employed structural biology techniques (specifically cryo-EM) to understand the effects of antibiotics on the cellular translation machinery in context of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23726-4">mitochondria</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.31.535098v1.abstract">mycobacteria</a>.</p>
<p>Outside the lab, I recently took part in the <a href="https://www.studentbiolab.ch/ideathon">Ideathon</a>, hosted and organized by the <a href="https://www.studentbiolab.ch/">Student Bio Lab</a> in Zürich, where our team came in 1st place for proposing innovative strategies for better design of biodegradable plastics. I also participated in the iGEM competition during my sophomore year of university as part of the <a href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Genspace">Genspace team</a>, a community biology lab based in Brooklyn, New York. The team won the <a href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Genspace/Measurement">Best Measurement Award</a>.</p>
<p>Music is another primary interest in my life. I&rsquo;ve been playing the guitar for over 15 years, starting with classical/fingerstyle guitar and then progressing to different genres of electric guitar (metal, rock, funk). I have recently started playing the bass as well, and I serve as a bassist for two bands, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/visualsnow___/">Visual Snow</a> (rock) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ppta_band/">PPTA</a> (funk), and help organize <a href="https://www.resonancejams.ch/en/">Resonance Jams</a>, a weekly jamming session for musicians in Zürich. I also have experience giving guitar lessons.</p>
<p>Other than science or music, my interests also extend to cooking, where I try as many recipes as possible from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JKenjiLopezAlt">J. Kenji López-Alt</a>, my newfound hobby of photography (usually while traveling), writing poetry and campaigns for D&amp;D, reading on a wide range of topics from philosophy to fantasy, and more recently, playing Baldurs Gate 3.</p>
<p>Prior to my past two years in Zürich, I lived in the US for about ten years, in Indonesia for about two years, and in India for the first ten years of my life.</p>
